<h1>How RMM Works</h1>
</p>
</div>
<div class="descr">
<p>RMM stands for remote monitoring and management. RMM software monitors devices and applications on a network for potential problems. The software gathers information from remote endpoints and networks to assess their health. If any issues arise, the software alerts the Managed IT Services Provider (MSP). The MSP can then monitor the issue or take remote control of the device to fix the problem.</p>
<p>RMM software works by using an agent, which is a lightweight software installed on all devices connected to the network. The agent scans the equipment for status changes and reports back to the central monitoring console. The agent gives the technician access to the monitored remote equipment.</p>
<p>RMM software can also help by standardizing where information is stored and the policies and settings used across a client base. For example, RMM tools can configure standard antivirus and patch management policies that can be applied globally to endpoints.<br />
      RMM software is also referred to as remote IT management or network management.</p>
